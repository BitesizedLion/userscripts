# Userscripts

This repository contains my personal collection of userscripts for Tampermonkey, a browser extension for managing userscripts.

These userscripts are designed to enhance my browsing experience, and might help you too.

## Installation

To use these userscripts, you'll need Tampermonkey installed in your browser. Once you have Tampermonkey installed, you can follow these steps to install a userscript:

1. Go to the `scripts` directory in this repository.
2. Click on the userscript you want to install.
3. Click on the "Raw" button to view the raw source code.
4. Tampermonkey should prompt you to install the script. Click "Install" to complete the installation process.

**NOTE**: Please be aware that these scripts do not have auto-update functionality. If any updates are made to a script, you will need to manually install the new version.
